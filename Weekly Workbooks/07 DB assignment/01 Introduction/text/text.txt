This workbook will lead you through the first assessed exercise,
the aim of which is to build a database server (from the ground up !).
This will not only give you more practice writing complex Java programmes,
but will also provide you with hands-on experience of using query languages. 
Note that this assignment WILL contribute to your unit mark (with a weighting of 40%). 

This assignment will be marked on the lab machines, so it is essential that you check that you
can compile and run your code using Maven on these machines before submission.

In order to identify the use of "derived" code (i.e. material "found" online or generated by AI), we will make use of code similarity checking tools.
Any code that has been determined to have been derived will be discounted during the marking process (resulting in a reduced final mark).
Remember that you will only receive credit for code that YOU yourself have written.

You are encouraged to talk about the assignments and discuss possible high-level implementation approaches with other students.
HOWEVER it is **essential** that you protect your own work (and don't share code with other students).
With this in mind, never exchange code with other students (via IM/email, GIT, forums, printouts, photos or any other means).
If you ask a question on the unit discussion forum, try to keep discussion at a high level
(i.e. not pasting in chunks of your code). If it is unavoidable to include code, only share
small fragments of the essential sections you need assistance with.
In addition, avoid the use of pair programming on this unit - you must produce all your own work !
Students submitting very similar work will be treated as collusion and will be dealt with using the university academic integrity processes.
