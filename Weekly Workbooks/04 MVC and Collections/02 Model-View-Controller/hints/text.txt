You may notice that some of the classes that we have provided in the template project implement the `Serializable` interface and many have a private attribute called `serialVersionUID`. GUI applications written in Java require classes to meet these requirements so that the application can be stored ('serialized') in certain situations. We won't be doing any serialization in this exercise, however we still need to include the above features in the project template (otherwise we will get warnings when we try to compile the project).
